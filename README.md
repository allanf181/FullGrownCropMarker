# Full Grown Crop Marker

Adds a little marker over all crops that are at their maximum age!

### Credits

This mod is based on the `Fully Aged Crop Marker` by [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/)  
Instead of adding custom json-models for vanilla crops, this mod adds a marker to all (vanilla/modded) crops that are at
their maximum age.
